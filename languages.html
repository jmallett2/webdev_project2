      <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
      <p>I love learning new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
      <p>Whenever I learn a new language I typically start with creating a chessbot or a rubik's cube solver.</p>

    <section id="java">

      <h2>Java</h2>
      <p>Java is the first language I would say I truly learned at a deep level.</p>
      <p>It's known for its object-oriented nature and its verbosity, with ridiculously long class names like "AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean".</p>
      <p>The Spring framework is my go-to for for building applications out of any language/framework combo.</p>

    <section id="python">

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>I taught myself python in 6th grade when I was stuck in my room for a week with the flu.</p>
      <p>Python is my go-to choice whenever I need to quickly process some data or update some files.</p>
      <p>While easy to write, my python code tends to devolve to a spaghetti-code mess when troubleshooting.</p>

    <section id="golang">

      <h2>Go</h2>
      <p>Co-developed by Ken Thompson (creator of a little-known language called C) while working at Google.</p>
      <p>Go's lightweight virtual threads (known as GoRoutines) make writing highly-concurrent code a breeze.</p>
      <p>Popular tools written in go are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Docker</li>
        <li>Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Terraform</li>
      </ul>
