      <h1>Gaming</h1>
      <p>I used to be a very avid gamer.</p>
      <p>My total playtime across every game is over 7000 hours.</p>
      <p>I suffered a wrist injury 2 years ago and took a break from gaming; I never really got back into it since then.</p>

      <h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</h2>
      <p>Hours Played: 3000</p>
      <p>I started reading Tom Clancy's books in middle school and that initially got me into the game.</p>
      <p>The game has absolutely nothing to do with any of Tom Clancy's works.</p>
      <p>Back in 2019 I was a top 500 player in the world.</p>

      <p>Hours Played: 600</p>
      <p>The Counter-Strike franchise is over 20 years old now.</p>

      <h2>Tom Clancy's The Division 2</h2>
      <p>Hours Played: 530</p>
      <p>Another Tom Clancy game which has nothing to do with his books.</p>
      <p>I used to be active in the speed run community, holding top 50 times in both of the game's raids.</p>
